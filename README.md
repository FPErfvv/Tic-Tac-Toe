# Tic-Tac-Toe
Welcome to Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, an AP Computer Science A project created by Fred Probst and Stef Linden! As complicated as it looks, Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is easy to learn and play. There are two modes, Two Player (player against player) and Random AI (player against AI that chooses randomly). To start the game, go to the game board by pressing play, and then start the game with the start button. The first player, X, goes first and can choose any spot on the board. However, the next player has to choose a spot from the tic-tac-toe board that coresponds with the position chosen by the first player. For example, if the first player chooses bottom left as their target, then the second player has to choose from the bottom left tic-tac-toe board. Have fun playing!
